The goal of this exercise is to convert a string to a new string where each character in the new string is "(" if that character appears only once in the original string, or ")" if that character appears more than once in the original string. Ignore capitalization when determining if a character is a duplicate.
Examples

"din"      =>  "((("
"recede"   =>  "()()()"
"Success"  =>  ")())())"
"(( @"     =>  "))((" 

Notes

Assertion messages may be unclear about what they display in some languages. If you read "...It Should encode XXX", the "XXX" is the expected result, not the input!

Sample Tests

import codewars_test as test
from solution import duplicate_encode

@test.describe("Duplicate Encoder")
def fixed_tests():
    @test.it('Basic Test Cases')
    def basic_test_cases():
        test.assert_equals(duplicate_encode("din"),"(((")
        test.assert_equals(duplicate_encode("recede"),"()()()")
        test.assert_equals(duplicate_encode("Success"),")())())","should ignore case")
        test.assert_equals(duplicate_encode("(( @"),"))((")
